## Paula's E-Commerce Website

### Project Description

Paula's E-Commerce Website is a fully responsive e-commerce platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While the website is functional, it's not fully operational, lacking a checkout process and some other functions. However, users can browse products, add them to the cart, and sort them based on various criteria.

The shop page fetches products dynamically from https://dummyjson.com, providing users with a diverse selection. Additionally, pagination is implemented to enhance the browsing experience, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of products.

### Key Features:

**Product Listing:** Browse a wide range of products sourced dynamically from an external API.<br>
**Product Sorting:** Sort products based on different criteria such as price or alphabetically.<br>
**Pagination:** Navigate through multiple pages of products efficiently.<br>
**Search Functionality:** Utilize the search bar to find specific products quickly.<br>
**Cart Management:** Add products to the cart, update quantities, and view the total amount in the cart page.<br>
**Single Product Page:** View detailed information about individual products, with the ability to add them to the cart.<br>
**SweetAlert2 Integration:** Enhance user experience with visually appealing alerts when adding products to the cart.<br>
**Hero Section Slider:** Engage users with a visually appealing slider in the hero section, powered by Tiny Slider.js.
